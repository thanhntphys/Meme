    "* Create a Python module (including `__init__.py`) in a directory called `QuoteEngine`.\n",
    "* Example quotes are provided in a variety of files. Take a moment to review the file formats in `./_data/SimpleLines` and `./_data/DogQuotes`.\n",
    "* Implement a simple `QuoteModel` class to encapsulate the body and author.\n",
    "* Implement an abstract base class, `IngestorInterface`. This class should define two methods with the following class method signatures:  `def can_ingest(cls, path) -> boolean` and  `def parse(cls, path: str) -> List[QuoteModel] `\n",
    "* Implement separate strategy objects that realize the `IngestorInterface` for each file type (csv, docx, pdf, txt).\n",

    "* Adding a quote body and a quote author to the image.\n",
